# Crawler Components

This directory contains the main crawler implementations for the Crawl4AI library.

## Structure

- `async/`: Asynchronous crawler implementations
  - Highly scalable crawlers using async/await
  - Optimized for large-scale crawling operations
- `sync/`: Synchronous crawler implementations
  - Traditional synchronous crawlers
  - Suitable for simpler crawling tasks

Each implementation follows the same interface but offers different performance characteristics and use cases.

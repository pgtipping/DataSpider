# Crawl4AI Integration Guide

To effectively incorporate the `crawl4ai` tool from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai) into your regular development workflow, you can follow these steps:

---

## 1. **Understand the Tool**

- `crawl4ai` is designed to crawl websites and extract their content, which can then be used for various purposes, such as feeding data into an LLM (Large Language Model) agent.
- It provides a simple API to fetch website content, including text, metadata, and other relevant information.

---

## 2. **Install and Set Up the Tool**

- Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai.git
  cd crawl4ai
  ```

- Install the required dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Ensure the tool is working by running the provided examples or tests.

---

## 3. **Integrate into Your Development Workflow**

- **Create a Wrapper Function**: Write a Python function that uses `crawl4ai` to fetch website content and process it for your project. For example:

  ```python
  from crawl4ai import WebCrawler

  def fetch_website_content(url):
      crawler = WebCrawler()
      result = crawler.crawl(url)
      return result.text  # or result.html, result.metadata, etc.
  ```

- **Save Extracted Content**: Store the crawled content in a format suitable for your LLM agent (e.g., JSON, plain text, or a database).

  ```python
  import json

  def save_content(url, output_file):
      content = fetch_website_content(url)
      with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
          json.dump({"url": url, "content": content}, f)
  ```

---

## 4. **Automate Documentation Fetching**

- **Use a Script**: Create a script that automatically fetches documentation from specific URLs and saves it to a designated directory.

  ```python
  import os

  DOCS_DIR = "project_docs"
  DOCS_URLS = [
      "https://example.com/docs",
      "https://another-example.com/api",
  ]

  if not os.path.exists(DOCS_DIR):
      os.makedirs(DOCS_DIR)

  for url in DOCS_URLS:
      filename = url.split("//")[1].replace("/", "_") + ".json"
      save_content(url, os.path.join(DOCS_DIR, filename))
  ```

- **Schedule Regular Updates**: Use a task scheduler (e.g., `cron` on Linux or Task Scheduler on Windows) to periodically fetch updated documentation.

---

## 5. **Integrate with Your LLM Agent**

- **Load Crawled Content**: When your LLM agent needs documentation, load the saved content into memory.

  ```python
  def load_docs(docs_dir):
      docs = []
      for filename in os.listdir(docs_dir):
          with open(os.path.join(docs_dir, filename), 'r') as f:
              docs.append(json.load(f))
      return docs
  ```

- **Feed Content to the LLM**: Use the loaded content as context for your LLM agent. For example:

  ```python
  from langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplate

  def query_llm(question, docs):
      context = "\n".join([doc["content"] for doc in docs])
      prompt = PromptTemplate(template="Context: {context}\nQuestion: {question}")
      llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=your_llm_model, prompt=prompt)
      return llm_chain.run(context=context, question=question)
  ```

---

## 6. **Optimize for Performance**

- **Cache Results**: Avoid repeatedly crawling the same URLs by caching the results locally.
- **Filter Relevant Content**: Use `crawl4ai`'s filtering capabilities (if available) to extract only the relevant parts of the website (e.g., specific sections or tags).

---

## 7. **Handle Errors and Edge Cases**

- **Check for Errors**: Ensure your script handles cases where the website is unavailable or the content cannot be extracted.
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect the website's `robots.txt` file and avoid overloading servers with too many requests.

---

## 8. **Test and Iterate**

- Test the integration thoroughly to ensure it works seamlessly with your LLM agent.
- Iterate on the design based on feedback and performance.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Run the script to fetch documentation from specified URLs.
2. Save the crawled content in a structured format.
3. Load the content into your LLM agent when needed.
4. Use the content as context for generating accurate and relevant responses.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate `crawl4ai` into your development workflow and enhance your LLM agent's capabilities with up-to-date documentation.
